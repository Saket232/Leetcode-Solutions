1. **Split the Input String**:
​
The string s is split by spaces, forming an array arr of individual words.
If the length of arr doesn’t match the length of pattern, return false immediately. This is because each character in pattern should correspond to one word in s.
​
2. **Bidirectional Mapping**:
Two HashMaps, mapPS and mapSP, are used to map characters in pattern to words in s (pattern char -> word) and words in s to characters in pattern (word -> pattern char).
​
mapPS (pattern-to-string): Maps each character in pattern to a corresponding word in s.
​
mapSP (string-to-pattern): Maps each word in s to a corresponding character in pattern.
​
3. **Loop Through the Pattern**:
​
For each character in pattern and corresponding word in s:
A. Check Inconsistencies:
If charP already has a mapped word in mapPS, but it doesn’t match stringS, it’s inconsistent, so return false.
​
Similarly, if stringS has a mapped character in mapSP, but it doesn’t match charP, return false.
​
B. Add Mappings:
If there are no inconsistencies, add the mappings in both mapPS and mapSP.
​
4. **Return true if Pattern Matches**:
​
If all characters and words consistently map to each other, the function returns true.
