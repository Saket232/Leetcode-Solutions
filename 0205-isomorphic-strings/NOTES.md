Two critical conditions that are needed to determine if s and t are isomorphic:
​
1. **One-to-one mapping:** Each character in s must map to exactly one unique character in t.
2. **No repeated mappings:** If a character in s maps to a character in t, then no other character in s can map to that same character in t.
​
Steps:
1. **Check Lengths**: If s and t don’t have the same length, they can’t be isomorphic, so we return false.
2. **Two Maps for Bidirectional Mapping**:
​
* mapST maps characters from s to characters in t.
* mapTS maps characters from t to characters in s
.
3. **Iterate through Characters**:
For each character in s and the corresponding character in t, check:
If mapST already has a mapping for s[i] that doesn't match t[i], return false.
If mapTS already has a mapping for t[i] that doesn't match s[i], return false.
If no conflicts are found, add the mappings s[i] -> t[i] and t[i] -> s[i].
4. **Return**: If we complete the loop without finding any inconsistency, the strings are isomorphic, so return true.
