1. **Edge Case**: If there's only one node (head.next == null), return null as removing the only node will leave the list empty.
2.  **Two-Pointer Setup**: Use two pointers, slow and fast, both starting at head.
3.  **Advance fast by n steps**: Move fast n nodes ahead of slow.If fast becomes null after this loop, it means we need to remove the first node (as the list length is exactly n), so we return head.next.
4.  **Move slow and fast simultaneously**: Now move fast to the end while moving slow along with it. This will position slow just before the node to be removed.
5.  **Remove the Node**: Skip over the target node by setting slow.next = slow.next.next.
​


**Why need the Moving the fast pointer n steps ahead?**
* By moving fast n steps ahead, we create a gap of n nodes between fast and slow.
* This gap allows fast to reach the end of the list while slow is exactly n nodes behind fast, which is also n nodes from the end.

**Explanation for Specific Parts**:
**if (fast == null) return head.next;**: This handles cases where the length of the list is exactly n, meaning fast reaches the end of the list after advancing n steps, so we need to remove the head node.

**Complexity**:
**Time Complexity**:
O(L), where L is the length of the linked list, as we only traverse it once.
**Space Complexity**:
O(1), as we use only a fixed number of pointers.
